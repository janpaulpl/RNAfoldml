# Getting started
1. OCaml 4.0.0+ has to be installed to ensure nothing breaks. This library uses no external dependencies except [`OUnit2` for tests](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ounit2/). 

2. Unzip `rnafoldml.zip` into your preferred directory.

3. Go in the unzipped `rnafoldml` folder and in the root directory, run `make build` in your command line. Build the docs with `make doc`.

4. Use the code in utop with `make utop`.
